            <h3 class="subtitle in1">Reference memory locations</h3>
            <hr>

            <h3 id="coreStructure">Operation:</h3>
            <p>
                Earlier on, variables have been explained to be locations in the computer memory that can be referenced. For a C++ program,
                when a variable is declared, the memory needed to store its value is assigned a specific memory location.
                These are then used if you are referencing or changing the value.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3 id="address">Address operator (&)</h3>
            <p>
                The address of a variable can be obtained by preceding the name of a variable with an ampersand sign (&), known as the address-of
                operator. The actual address of a variable in memory cannot be known before runtime. The variable that stores
                the address of another variable (like foo in the previous example) is what in C++ is called a pointer. Pointers
                are a very powerful feature of the language that has many uses in lower level programming.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3 id="dereference">Dereference operator (*)</h3>
            <p>
                As just seen, a variable which stores the address of another variable is called a pointer. Pointers are said to "point to"
                the variable whose address they store. An interesting property of pointers is that they can be used to access
                the variable they point to directly. This is done by preceding the pointer name with the dereference operator
                (*). The operator itself can be read as "value pointed to by".
            </p>
            The reference and dereference operators are thus complementary:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>&</b> is the address-of operator, and can be read simply as "address of"</li>
                <li>
                    <b>*</b> is the dereference operator, and can be read as "value pointed to by"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
